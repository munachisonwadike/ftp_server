Test cases for FTP client (need to complete)

1) Different permutations of Username Password
requirements, to ensure that if the user fails to give the right password after a good username, they will have to give password from scratch

a) 
ftp> USER user
ftp> PASS pass

b)
ftp> USER user
ftp> user USER
ftp> USER user

c)
ftp> USER user 
ftp> user USER
ftp> PASS pass

2) Testing !PWD after authentication same approach for (!LS and !CD)

ftp> !PWD //should only work after authentication
ftp> USER //should say command not valid
ftp> !PWD //should still print current directory so had to debug this


 

Test cases for FTP server

1) PWD (multiple times)

ran PWD multiple times and with other commands in between to ensure it consistently gives the same ouput

2) CD to test dir
ftp> CD TEST //should say the directory doesn't exist
ftp> CD testdir //should work and consecutive PWD should say we are in that dir

3) GET and POST
Created dummy files which I tried to tranfer using my get and post commands, and debugged the code until the files where getting copied exactly as needed


Also, typing the lower cases of any of the commands should not work, such as say 
4) cd testdir

Had to fix this bug, whereby the server prints out "Command not valid" twice, rather than once. This also happened with lower case"put" and "get"
