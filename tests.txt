Test cases for FTP client (need to complete)

1) Different permutations of Username Password
requirements, to ensure that if the user fails to give the right password after a good username, they will have to give password from scratch

a) 
ftp> USER user
ftp> PASS pass

b)
ftp> USER user
ftp> user USER
ftp> USER user

c)
ftp> USER user 
ftp> user USER
ftp> PASS pass

2) Testing PWD after authentication

ftp> PWD 
ftp> USER //should say command not valid
ftp> PWD //should still print current directory so had to debug this



Test cases for FTP server

1) PWD (multiple times)

ran PWD multiple times and with other commands in between to ensure it consistently gives the same ouput

2) CD to test dir
ftp> CD TEST //should say the directory doesn't exist
ftp> CD testdir //should work and consecutive PWD should say we are in that dir

3)
